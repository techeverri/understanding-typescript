# 16. Object Types

## [Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

### [Object](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#object)

```ts
const product: object = {
  firstName: "Marty",
  lastName: "McFly",
};
```

It's not recommended to use `object` like this because type inference can take
care of it

Generally, you won't need to use this.
